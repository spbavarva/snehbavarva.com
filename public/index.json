Ability to create detection rules by identifying specific WMI queries, comparing processes for virtual machine detection, and analyzing registry keys or file paths associated with virtual environments.\nScenario Talion suspects that the threat actor carried out anti-virtualization checks to avoid detection in sandboxed environments. Your task is to analyze the event logs and identify the specific techniques used for virtualization detection. Byte Doctor requires evidence of the registry checks or processes the attacker executed to perform these checks.\nProvided artifacts Microsoft-Windows-Powershell.evtx Windows-Powershell-Operational.evtx Task 1 Question: Which WMI class did the attacker use to retrieve model and manufacturer information for virtualization detection?\nAs we are provided with the 2 event log files and question is asking about WMI classes, it means we have to look for the usage of WMI in the powershell query.\nwe can use windows event viewer\ror Hayabusa\r. As I heard a lot about Hayabusa and I am also learning, we will use that.\nAccording to the task, the attacker did use a WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation)\rquery to gather system information in order to determine whether the current environment is a virtual machine. we can search for every command run with wmi query\nhayabusa-3.3.0-win-x64.exe search -f \u0026#34;Microsoft-Windows-Powershell.evtx\u0026#34; -k \u0026#34;Wmi\u0026#34; -J -o \u0026#34;wmi_result.json\u0026#34; We can clearly see the command line and which class has been used by attacker.\nAnswer: Win32_ComputerSystem\nTask 2 Question: Which WMI query did the attacker execute to retrieve the current temperature value of the machine?\nIn the same json output file we can see all usage of the WMI and which query performed by attacker.\nAnswer: SELECT * FROM MSAcpi_ThermalZoneTemperature\nTask 3 Question: The attacker loaded a PowerShell script to detect virtualization. What is the function name of the script?\nFrom question it\u0026rsquo;s evident that it\u0026rsquo;s kind of information gathering activity attacker is performing. We will run hayabusa with all available rules to detect the script execution.\nhayabusa-3.3.0-win-x64.exe csv-timeline -f \u0026#34;Windows-Powershell-Operational.evtx\u0026#34; -o \u0026#34;powershell_timeline2.csv\u0026#34; One of the script blocks found through this rule (at 2025-04-09 09:20:53) indeed contains a function that implements the VM detection capability described in the task.\nAnswer: Check-VM\nTask 4 Question: Which registry key did the above script query to retrieve service details for virtualization detection?\nGoing through the same identified script we find that the script retrives service details from \u0026lsquo;HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Services\u0026rsquo;\nhayabusa-3.3.0-win-x64.exe search -f \u0026#34;Windows-Powershell-Operational.evtx\u0026#34; -k \u0026#34;HKLM\u0026#34; -J -o \u0026#34;HKLM_result.json\u0026#34; Answer: HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Services\nTask 5 Question: The VM detection script can also identify VirtualBox. Which processes is it comparing to determine if the system is running VirtualBox?\nWe scroll down until we come across the \u0026lsquo;VirtualBox\u0026rsquo; comment in the script. Just below it, we can see that the script retrieves process details using the \u0026lsquo;Get-Process\u0026rsquo; cmdlet and compares them with \u0026lsquo;vboxservice.exe\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;vboxtray.exe\u0026rsquo; to determine whether it\u0026rsquo;s running in a VirtualBox environment\nAnswer: vboxservice.exe, vboxtray.exe\nTask 6 Question: The VM detection script prints any detection with the prefix ‘This is a’. Which two virtualization platforms did the script detect?\nThoroughly analyzing the script, we do observe that it prints virtual machine detection results using the phrase \u0026lsquo;This is a\u0026rsquo; followed by the name of the VM. To ind the output, we search for the string \u0026lsquo;This is a\u0026rsquo; within the \u0026lsquo;Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell\u0026rsquo; logs and confirm that, according to the script, the operating system is running inside either \u0026lsquo;Hyper-V\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;VMware\u0026rsquo;\nAnswer: Hyper-V, Vmware\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/ctf/htb/sherlocks/phantom-check/","summary":"\u003cstyle\u003e\r\n  .machine-info-table {\r\n    width: 100%;\r\n    border-collapse: collapse;\r\n    margin: 1.5rem 0;\r\n    background-color: #111;\r\n     \r\n    border-radius: 8px;\r\n    overflow: hidden;\r\n    background-color: #181818;\r\n     \r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .machine-info-table td,\r\n  .machine-info-table th {\r\n    padding: 0.75rem 1rem;\r\n    border-bottom: 1px solid #2d2d2d;\r\n    vertical-align: top;\r\n    color: #e5e5e5;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .machine-info-table tr:last-child td {\r\n    border-bottom: none;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .machine-info-thumb {\r\n    display: block;\r\n    width: 300px;\r\n    height: auto;\r\n    margin: 1rem auto;\r\n    border-radius: 10px;\r\n    box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);\r\n    object-fit: contain;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .machine-info-label {\r\n    font-weight: 600;\r\n    color: #9ca3af;  \r\n    white-space: nowrap;\r\n    font-size: 0.85rem;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .machine-info-value {\r\n    font-weight: 500;\r\n    color: #f3f4f6;  \r\n    font-size: 0.95rem;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .machine-info-tags {\r\n    margin-top: 0.5rem;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .machine-info-tag {\r\n    display: inline-block;\r\n    background-color: #2a2a2a;\r\n    color: #60a5fa;\r\n    padding: 0.3rem 0.75rem;\r\n    border-radius: 999px;\r\n    font-size: 0.75rem;\r\n    margin: 0.2rem 0.2rem 0 0;\r\n  }\r\n  .machine-info-table tr:hover td {\r\n    background-color: #202020;\r\n    transition: background 0.2s ease;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @media (max-width: 600px) {\r\n    .machine-info-table td {\r\n      padding: 0.75rem;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .machine-info-thumb {\r\n      width: 100px;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\u003c/style\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ctable class=\"machine-info-table\"\u003e\r\n  \u003ctr\u003e\r\n    \u003ctd rowspan=\"7\"\u003e\r\n      \r\n      \u003cimg src=\"/images/ctf/htb/phantom.png\" class=\"machine-info-thumb\" alt=\"Machine Image\" /\u003e\r\n      \r\n    \u003c/td\u003e\r\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\r\n  \u003ctr\u003e\r\n    \u003ctd class=\"machine-info-label\"\u003eRelease Date\u003c/td\u003e\r\n    \u003ctd\u003e06 Jun 2025\u003c/td\u003e\r\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\r\n  \u003ctr\u003e\r\n    \u003ctd class=\"machine-info-label\"\u003eRetire Date\u003c/td\u003e\r\n    \u003ctd\u003e06 Jun 2025\u003c/td\u003e\r\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\r\n  \r\n  \u003ctr\u003e\r\n    \u003ctd class=\"machine-info-label\"\u003eDifficulty\u003c/td\u003e\r\n    \u003ctd\u003e\u003cspan class=\"machine-info-value\"\u003eVery Easy\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\r\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \u003ctr\u003e\r\n    \u003ctd class=\"machine-info-label\"\u003eCreator\u003c/td\u003e\r\n    \u003ctd\u003eiamr007\u003c/td\u003e\r\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\r\n  \r\n\u003c/table\u003e\r\n\r\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-we-gain\"\u003eWhat we gain?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbility to create detection rules by identifying specific WMI queries, comparing processes for virtual machine detection, and analyzing registry keys or file paths associated with virtual environments.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Operation Blackout 2025: Phantom Check"},{"content":"\rRelease Date\r06 Jun 2025\rRetire Date\r06 Jun 2025\rDifficulty\rVery Easy\rCreator\riamr007\rScenario Byte Doctor Reyes is investigating a stealthy post-breach attack where several expected security logs and Windows Defender alerts appear to be missing.

It doesn\u0026rsquo;t bring monetary rewards, but it provides a genuine sense of accomplishment that I\u0026rsquo;ve contributed something meaningful, helping secure software that others rely on\nMy initial (and Failed) attempt(s) A good friend of mine had 33 CVEs, and this motivated me immensely. Inspired, I started seriously looking into vulnerability hunting in November 2024. I read countless blogs, cloned many GitHub repositories onto a dedicated VM, ran numerous applications, conducted source code analyses, and tested various random ideas.\nInterestingly, I found several bugs in some applications. However, I hit a roadblock! I didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to properly register these bugs or create valid Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs). Simply because I can see my vulnerabilities in the code but when I try to exploit them, it\u0026rsquo;s all in the local environment and on main application it never worked. This happened with 4-5 bugs and I dropped the idea of getting CVE back then and come back to it later on.\n\u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot;\rChanging the mindset By the end of April 2025, my perspective shifted. Now, my goal wasn\u0026rsquo;t just to earn a CVE; I genuinely wanted to contribute to cybersecurity and help secure others.\nSurprisingly, one podcast of Armann\rcame on my YouTube feed. It had only few hundreds views and looks very generic, I was just sitting and thought to just start in the background and do my other work. I heard that guy got 7 CVEs under his name and got curious about how he found that.\nI did some OSINT on the guy and check where he found his CVEs. I thought okay let\u0026rsquo;s give it a try on that Unifiedtransform application (3k ⭐, 1.3k forks on GitHub).\nDiscovering the bugs I set up Unifiedtransform locally and followed the official instructions to get familiar with the application. It had three distinct roles: Admin, Teacher, and Student. After exploring thoroughly as an admin, an intriguing thought crossed my mind:\nWhat if I tried accessing an admin-only endpoint as a teacher?\nand that was my \u0026ldquo;aha!\u0026rdquo; moment!💡\n(I have detailed the Proof-of-Concepts for both my CVEs clearly on GitHub)\n🔗 CVE-2025-46203\r🔗 CVE-2025-46204\rFound bugs now what? I was super happy that now I have proper bugs which are not duplicates and it\u0026rsquo;s on popular repo. I just have to contact the vendor, make PoC and register for the CVEs. But how to proceed with disclosure?\nFor this process, I can\u0026rsquo;t thank enough to Florian. Who wrote amazing writeup titled \u0026ldquo;found-a-vulnerability-3-easy-steps-to-submitting-a-cve\u0026rdquo;\ron his medium on what to do after finding a vulnerability.\nI followed his process. Raise the issue for vendor, made PoCs, registered on CVE forms.\nAnd as he mentioned, waiting is the worst part! After submission After submitting, I expected a response within a week or two. However, the wait stretched to an anxious six weeks before finally receiving my CVE IDs.\nEven after CVE numbers were assigned, I mistakenly listed the software version as \u0026lsquo;X\u0026rsquo; in my initial submission, overlooking the guidelines. I had to correct this mistake twice, which taught me a valuable lesson:\nAlways read the guidelines thoroughly before finalizing your submissions! FINALLY!! I got my first two CVEs on my name and day can\u0026rsquo;t be better!\nCVE-2025-46203\rCVE-2025-46204\rWhat I learned The importance of patience Clear documentation is everything Even “simple” bugs matter Open source needs more eyes \u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot;\rWhat\u0026rsquo;s next I will keep continueing looking for open source work and next time I will try to find on something even more popular thing.\nI\u0026rsquo;m motivated more than ever to continue contributing to open source security. My next goal is targeting even more popular projects and uncovering impactful vulnerabilities.\nI’d love to connect with others interested in security research!

Definitely it was good one to get and in this blog I will be sharing my journey from deciding to take this cert and actually getting it. This will be long, so bear with it! Less go\u0026hellip;\nWhy this exam? I am a huge fan of HTB Academy\rand it\u0026rsquo;s content and I recommend the platform to anyone looking to learn. I was just going through each of their job role path and though to give it a try for their SOC Analyst Path\ra try in the December but I quit that in few days after doing few % and then I talked with people, look at study materials and some YT videos of course - I figured out that Defensive side of security is best suited for me and I enjoy it more than Web-Pentesting (I hate BURP!). I will come to my background\rand timeline\rof my study and how long I took to prepare for the exam later in the module. But this is how I decided to take the exam.\nwho is it for Below is what HTB has to say:\nBut I do believe that this content (Content) is absolutely helpful for any Pentester or any Red teamer to understand how your actual attack works behind the scene and how it can be detected. For example, mimikatz can be easily detected, which is known by anyone but how it\u0026rsquo;s getting detected? that\u0026rsquo;s what you wil learn in this path.\nI highly recommend anyone who wants to explore how blue team works or how incident response team works as well as to the red teamers and pentester to understand how defending team operates, which could give you more ways to bypass certain things with clear understanding.\n\u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot;\rPre-Requisites It is advisable to have a bit of knowledge in web and AD infrastructure penetration testing concepts, as per HTB. If you are very new, I suggest taking the Pre-Requisites\rpath as it will be really helpful. Of course, the attacks or the offensive knowledge needed for the exam will be taught in the path itself.\nPersonal suggestion: But I still recommend to have some short of AD pentesting knowledge, which will help you to understand the full flow from attacking an infra to defending it. You can have this in that Pre-Requisites path and I strongly suggest you to at least do AD module\rfrom that.\nPricing The SOC Analyst path is available at HTB Academy platform and fortunately there are multiple affordable subscription models for different users. I used their student subscription which is only $8 per months if you have a .edu email and I am using that from almost 1.5 years now. This will give you access to all the modules in the SOC Analyst path, the pre-requisites path and even access to all their main certifications paths (CPTS, CBBH and CDSA).\nAnd yes, a voucher ($210) comes with two attempts. To qualify for the second attempt, you need to submit a report detailing your progress.\nIf you don’t have a .edu email fortunately there are some other affordable subscriptions, which you can find here\r. Though if you want to learn more about academy pricing, this is the place\r.\n\u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot;\rMy background A little bit of myself to give you context, which I am dividing into Defensive and Offensive categories.\nDefense side\nNo defensive side knowledge No DFIR knowledge Never touched ELK-stack, and Splunk only for college assignment Never did any sherlock or let\u0026rsquo;s defend lab (cause I wasn\u0026rsquo;t even aware lol) Basic knowledge of Malware Average with Assembly Offensive side\nOSCP, eJPTv2 and some more Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree in IT (stong networking and OS knowledge) Master\u0026rsquo;s degree in Cybersecurity (on-going, still it was beneficial for Splunk) Solid understanding of AD Infra and Attacks Some boxes on HTB\rand THM\r\u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot;\rCourse overview Overall this path was great to start awaken defensive side and CDSA path consists of the following 15 modules: (if you meet the pre-requisites, all the 15 modules are much easier to learn)\nBelow is my personal review of each module,\nModule/Path review Incident Handling Process: This module covers the core stages of incident handling. It’s a foundational overview meant to prepare you for more technical, SOC-focused modules. And seriously for exam, this module may not worth but in reality this worth the most than any other modules! Security Monitoring \u0026amp; SIEM Fundamentals: Core SIEM fundamentals and you will learn basic use of Elastic Stack. Setup of ELK, finding events and triaging process. Windows Event Logs \u0026amp; Finding Evil: You will learn about Windows Event Logs and Sysmon Logs, how to detect threats like DLL hijacking and credential dumping. It also explores ETW, and hands-on techniques to investigate malicious activity with tools like Get-WinEvent and Event Viewer. Introduction to Threat Hunting \u0026amp; Hunting With Elastic: Threat Hunting and CTI fundamentals are covered here as well as at the end, you will have to asses a phishing scenario from phishing mail to how it implemented RAT. (tough one for me) Understanding Log Sources \u0026amp; Investigating with Splunk: You are introduced to Splunk and you\u0026rsquo;ll know how to use diverse log sources and it\u0026rsquo;s importance using Splunk Windows Attacks \u0026amp; Defense: Almost all type of basic attacks of AD infra is covered here and you will enjoy a lot if you know AD stuff before-hand :) Also. It taught how to set up a honeypot and understand how event IDs for detecting the attacks can vary when a honeypot is used. (most useful for real-life) Intro to Network Traffic Analysis: Networking knowledge and analysis with tools like: Wireshark and Tcpdump Intermediate Network Traffic Analysis: Detailed module on networking concepts like: ARP, 802.11, ICMP tunneling, XSS and SSL detection, TCP and TLS handshake. (I don\u0026rsquo;t know wju this module is rated easy and previous rated as Medium) Working with IDS/IPS: Understanding of IDS and IPS tools with Suricata, Snort, and Zeek Introduction to Malware Analysis: Static and Dynamic detection method of malware on Windows and Linux with code analysis and debugging. (If you aren\u0026rsquo;t familiar with Assembly, I suggest completing Intro to Assembly Language module\r)\nJavaScript Deobfuscation: You\u0026rsquo;ll learn how to decode and analyze obfuscated JavaScript, which is common practice by attackers YARA \u0026amp; Sigma for SOC Analysts: YARA and Sigma rules are important and you will understand why and how it\u0026rsquo;s used. Also you can checkout my blog for that as well! Introduction to Digital Forensics: DFIR! Best module to learn the most of it. So many new tools and full-fledge investigation of scenario on DFIR. This is my personal favourite module as well and best skill assessment in whole path! Detecting Windows Attacks with Splunk: Most easiest one if you know AD stuff. You will complete this in like a couple of hours Security Incident Reporting: Basically they will tell you how to write a report in real-life as well as in exam. My timeline It took me one and half month from starting the path to ending the exam. I started path in Feb and started exam in around 20th March.\nBut I tracked my time with Toggle Track\rcause I want just curious whether it really takes that much of time which HTB tells us. I figured out I completed modules with lesser time.\nAll modules were not tracked here but I get all of those done in line 70 hours roughly. Which is around 6 hours/day and 12-13 days. This was just my curiosity, ignore it lol.\nBut yes as I mentioned in start\r, I started early but it was all blank in the Feb after I come from winter break.\n\u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot;\rEXAM!! Now comes the most interesting part! As you might have know that it\u0026rsquo;s a 7 days long exam and you have to investigate 2 incidents and submit a report on them. Along with you have to find 17/20 in order to pass the exam. You can read some details about exam objective in below image which was taken from Sysreptor\r. (I will come on this later in the note taking\rsection)\nI found 19 flags in two and half days and it took me 4 days to write a report on that. I knew that report will take more time than finding flags and I was dedicating 8 hours/day for these whole 6 and half days of my exam. First flag was took the most of my time and cause of wording as I was dumb-dumb to not understand that silly thing and god damn, DO NOT FORGET TO REFRESH YOUR EXAM PANEL BEFORE SUBMITTING FLAG!\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know if it was only with me or not, but I was giving right flag all the time but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting that and after F 7-8 hours when I hit the refresh button on my browser and submitted the same thing, it accepted!\nBut yeah rest of the part was just natural and you will feel like you are lost but you knew that you saw something similar in your SOC analyst path, just revisit that module and make your strategy. 7 days are more than enough for this exam and even if it\u0026rsquo;s not, there\u0026rsquo;s 2nd attempt.\nIt may happen that you feel completely lost for particular question, just skip it after 1-2 hours and go to next one. You will find answer for that later. None of those flags are hard once you understand the gist of those incidents. But seriously whatever you need to pass, it\u0026rsquo;s right in there in the modules. So, use that!\nreporting \u0026amp; note taking Note Taking obviously there are plenty of note-taking apps like Obsidian, Notion, OneNote, Joplin, etc. I personally use Obsidian. Just keep your study notes ready, which you made about Path and I hope you understand every commands and queries which was provided in the path. Because just copy-pasting won\u0026rsquo;t help you in the exam.\nPro Tip: You have to understand like if there\u0026rsquo;s spawn of cmd.exe from notepad.exe then you should know which place you have to look after, how to find user from that, what event ID to focus on to get further information, etc.\nTake screenshots of your findings and put every SIEM queries and commands in your notes which you have used during your exam. This will be helpful when you start doing report writing.\nReporting There are mainly two options for you here:\nWord Template Sysreptor\rWord template provided during the exam. Also, you can refer to the last module of the SOC Analyst Path for reporting, as I mentioned earlier in the module review\rthat in this module they basically tells us what type of report they want. Here\u0026rsquo;s their Google Doc\ras well.\nI started with Sysreptor as everyone said that we don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about formatting and all, but in 1-2 hours I figured out that naah, it\u0026rsquo;s not for me. I need full control of my document and I want to format it and highlight things as I want.\nAlso for reporting, I would advice you to make a timeline first in your notes or somewhere then start report. I used below template,\nTime: Activity: Description: Discovery Method: This is just rough template for each activity in the incident. First prepare something like this then start reporting. This will save you a lot of time because you have to chain your findings as you can see in Security Incident Reporting Module\r.\nAnd huge thanks to MITRE FRAMEWORK\r, it will really help you a lot during reporting of your incident and after completing this exam, I understand the true importance of it.\nTips - sherlocks? Of course, take proper notes and screenshots is must Once again, report rigorously because that\u0026rsquo;s what which will be graded at the end Make a timeline of incidents Stay organized with your workspace and naming conventions If you are stuck but familiar with situation, go and refer that module If you find any answer by luck, try to reverse engineer it. (It worked for me on multiple occasions) Don\u0026rsquo;t stress yourself, you got plenty of time There are many more tips like this but I understand that if you are staring this exam then you have basic understanding of your routine, health, and sleep. This exam is structured as any full time person can also tackle it by doing 6-7 hours/day.\nExtra prep Personally I haven\u0026rsquo;t done much of it. But yes, I did BOTS (Boss of the SOC)\rSplunk challenges and definitely I can recommend that as that will be most closest to the actual exam. (which is still not close but still)\nAnd as everyone said, I tried few sherlocks but those are completely different from what I have learned from SOC Analyst Path on the HTB Academy. I mean you can use that knowledge but it\u0026rsquo;s still completely different and after taking the exam I can even verify that. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to do any sherlocks for exam.\nBut but but, it\u0026rsquo;s really great exercise to do in general to improve your knowledge and decide whether you want to do more sherlocks before attempting exam or not only after experiencing that. Personally I did the following sherlocks:\nMeerkat\rLoggy\rBrutus\rUFO-1\rNoxious\rUnit42\rAlso, DFIR Report site\rcontains various incident response reports and going through them gives you idea of reporting and also familiarizes you with various incidents and how to detect it.\nAfter the exam You found the flags, wrote full report on both incidents, now time for that most relaxing point when you upload your PDF and hit that SUBMIT button!!!!\nFinally you did that, shut down your thing and go get your stuff and leave for, THE MOON 🚀\nIn 18-20 business days you will hear back from HTB with some briefing of your report and you can order your Physical cert. That pin is absolutely worth it!\n\u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot;\rPath feedback and improvements Suggestions As I mentioned about every modules and they are really very well structured and detailed, still I found some of the modules are really vague and below are my Suggestions:\nLike in Detecting Windows Attacks with Splunk\rmodule, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t clear that if we found something then whether it\u0026rsquo;s false positive or actual movement of advisory. I know people can understand this with their experience with working but still it won\u0026rsquo;t hurt HTB to include 1-2 paragraph about that.\nAlthough DFIR\rmodule was best but still there was not enough information about KAPE files and how to use Velociraptor tool. That module can be improved with few more sections.\nMalware Analysis\rmodule can be more challenging and more practical with scenario to investigate rather than just telling about how to use this and that. Something similar to DFIR module.\nLittle bit of Phishing part is covered in Threat Hunting \u0026amp; Hunting With Elastic\rbut that\u0026rsquo;s the most common attack in the real life, I believe phishing attack should be cover with various scenarios and how to detect it.\nBusiness Email Compromise should be included in this Path as it\u0026rsquo;s one of the most important part for any Analyst in the company.\n\u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot;\rMentions Definitely first one would be HTB team who even refunded me money for accident purchase of another voucher. You are really great and content over HTB Academy is no match for any other platforms out there right now. It\u0026rsquo;s the BEST!\nAlso huge thanks to my mate Hypercure (HC), who helped me a lot and motivated me to learn more and Sunny Singh, who shared me his experience in this field. zzzz and timmytrill, our dank discussions 🚀 is flying high! And dakshn, have you learned how to read memdumps? lol\n\u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot;\rFinally it\u0026rsquo;s done! what\u0026rsquo;s next? Finally, I want to emphasize that you can undertake this exam without any prior defensive knowledge before starting the SOC Analyst path. All you need is time and a commitment to complete it.\nBut still there\u0026rsquo;s many more things to cover and I am aiming for more SOC and IR stuff cause\u0026hellip;..\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/cdsa/","summary":"\u003cfigure class=\"align-center \"\u003e\n    \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/blog/blog-4-CDSA/cdsa.png#center\"\n         alt=\"HTB CDSA\"/\u003e \u003cfigcaption\u003e\n            \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e“Every new challenge is a chance to discover a stronger version of yourself”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"overview\"\u003eOverview\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I am happy to say that I am now HTB CDSA certified!

Below is a detailed breakdown of how they work using visual examples.\nThe first image below explains the structure and fields of a Sigma rule:\nKey Elements:\n• title : The purpose of the rule. Example: Potential LethalHTA Technique Execution.\r• id: A unique identifier (UUID) for tracking and referencing the rule.\r• status: Indicates whether the rule is test, stable, or deprecated.\r• description: A summary of what the rule detects and why.\r• references: Helpful URLs or documents supporting the rule’s logic.\r• author \u0026amp; date: Credit to the rule creator and its creation date.\r• tags: MITRE ATT\u0026amp;CK techniques or context tags like attack.defense_evasion.\r• logsource: Tells Sigma what logs to look at (e.g., process_creation on Windows).\r• detection: Defines the search conditions (explained in more detail below 👇).\r• falsepositives: Known legitimate activity that might match the rule.\r• level: The severity if this rule triggers (low, medium, high, or critical).\rUnderstanding the Detection Logic (Search Identifiers \u0026amp; Conditions) The second image explains how Sigma uses search identifiers and conditions in the detection section:\nInside the detection field:\nselection1 and selection2: These are search identifiers that define what to look for in logs.\rFor example, selection1 checks if Image ends with cmd.exe or powershell.exe.\rselection2 looks for ParentImage values like winword.exe or excel.exe.\rcondition: Combines selections using logical operations.\rIn this case: selection1 AND selection2 means both conditions must match.\r\u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot;\rDeveloping Sigma Rule Let’s take an example: detecting credential dumping attempts by looking for access to LSASS memory using suspicious permission flags.\nWhen attackers try to dump credentials from lsass.exe, they usually request special access permissions. One suspicious flag is 0x1010, which implies the process is trying to read and query LSASS memory.\nWe want to detect:\nEvent ID: 10\rTargetImage: lsass.exe\rGrantedAccess: 0x1010\rwhy 0x1010 is important? because it implies both reading and querying information from the process\nnow we can use this, YEAH BABY!\ntitle: LSASS Access with rare GrantedAccess flag status: experimental description: This rule will detect when a process tries to access LSASS memory with suspicious access flag 0x1010 date: 2023/07/08 tags: - attack.credential_access - attack.t1003.001 logsource: category: process_access product: windows detection: selection: TargetImage|endswith: \u0026#39;\\lsass.exe\u0026#39; GrantedAccess|endswith: \u0026#39;0x1010\u0026#39; condition: selection this below is how we can transform our rule into query here with sigmac, YAML to powershell-query\npython sigmac -t powershell \u0026#39;C:\\Rules\\sigma\\proc_access_win_lsass_access.yml\u0026#39; now we can use that rule which this sigmac gave\nGet-WinEvent -Path C:\\Events\\YARASigma\\lab_events.evtx | where {($_.ID -eq \u0026#34;10\u0026#34; -and $_.message -match \u0026#34;TargetImage.*.*\\\\lsass.exe\u0026#34; -and $_.message -match \u0026#34;GrantedAccess.*.*0x1010\u0026#34;) } | select TimeCreated,Id,RecordId,ProcessId,MachineName,Message but this give us false positive many times, so always be cautious \u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot;\rHunting with Sigma in Splunk Now that we\u0026rsquo;ve developed a Sigma rule, let’s move to the real fun—threat hunting with Sigma in Splunk!\nThanks to sigmac, we can convert our Sigma rules into Splunk Query Language (SPL) and start hunting right away 🔥\n#1 – LSASS Dump via MiniDump Function (comsvcs.dll) Attackers often abuse comsvcs.dll via rundll32.exe to dump LSASS memory. first translate rule to SPL\npython sigmac -t splunk C:\\Tools\\chainsaw\\sigma\\rules\\windows\\process_access\\proc_access_win_lsass_dump_comsvcs_dll.yml -c .\\config\\splunk-windows.yml now we can easily use that query to detect minidump in Splunk\n#2 – Notepad Spawning Suspicious Child Process Why would Notepad spawn PowerShell or other binaries?

We can analyze disk artifacts, memory images, or even live endpoint telemetry. Also, YARA rules allow to detect known malware patterns, identify suspicious behavior.\nIn this blog, we\u0026rsquo;ll walk through real-world hunting scenarios. We’ll build and test rules against malware samples like WannaCry, Dharma, APT17, and Turla. We’ll also explore how YARA integrates with memory forensics and event telemetry (ETW) for runtime detection.\nBut before that,\nWhat is YARA? YARA (\u0026quot;Yet Another Ridiculous Acronym\u0026quot;) is a pattern-matching tool for identifying malware families based on string signatures, binary patterns, metadata.\nToo much? it\u0026rsquo;s just rules that helps to detect patterns. Okay let\u0026rsquo;s see where it\u0026rsquo;s useful:\nMalware detection and classification File analysis and classification IOC detection Community-driven rule sharing Custom security solution Custom YARA rules Incident Response Proactive Threat Hunting How actually it works The image below illustrates the basic workflow of YARA detection.\nAnalysts observe suspicious strings, binary patterns, or structural behaviors in known malware samples. These are then translated into YARA rules. The YARA scan engine uses these rules—along with optional modules—to evaluate files, memory, or network traffic for matches. If a file contains characteristics that satisfy the conditions in a rule, it\u0026rsquo;s flagged as potentially malicious.\nBelow is simple YARA rule:\nrule my_rule { meta: author = \u0026#34;Sneh\u0026#34; description = \u0026#34;Detects test strings\u0026#34; strings: $a = \u0026#34;test\u0026#34; $b = \u0026#34;string\u0026#34; $c = \u0026#34;rule\u0026#34; condition: all of them } A rule contains:\nMetadata: for attribution/documentation\nStrings: literal strings, hex patterns, or regex\nCondition: logic to match the strings\nReal World Example of Detecting WannaCry rule Ransomware_WannaCry { meta: author = \u0026#34;Madhukar Raina\u0026#34; description = \u0026#34;Detects WannaCry ransomware\u0026#34; strings: $s1 = \u0026#34;tasksche.exe\u0026#34; $s2 = \u0026#34;www.iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com\u0026#34; $s3 = \u0026#34;mssecsvc.exe\u0026#34; condition: all of them } This rule detects the presence of WannaCry ransomware by matching three key indicators observed in the malware: its dropped executable (tasksche.exe), the kill-switch domain used for sandbox evasion, and the service binary (mssecsvc.exe) it installs. Requiring all three strings ensures high confidence in detection while minimizing false positives.\n\u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot;\rDeveloping YARA rules we can do this manually and automatically. so let\u0026rsquo;s look into both ways:\nManually writing YARA rules As we know that YARA rule is made up of three main blocks: meta, strings, and condition.\nSo, we just have to write what we want to detect but this is the pain in the butt as it takes a lot of research. Here’s an example rule to detect UPX-packed binaries, commonly used to compress or obfuscate malware:\nrule UPX_packed_executable { meta: description = \u0026#34;Detects UPX-packed executables\u0026#34; strings: $string_1 = \u0026#34;UPX0\u0026#34; $string_2 = \u0026#34;UPX1\u0026#34; $string_3 = \u0026#34;UPX2\u0026#34; condition: all of them } This rule checks for classic UPX section names in binaries (UPX0, UPX1, UPX2) which are indicators that the file has been packed using the UPX packer—often a red flag during malware triage.\nUsing yarGen for Rule Generation yarGen is an automated tool that helps generate YARA rules from a malware sample by identifying unique strings and entropy sections.\nSetup:\npip install -r requirements.txt python yarGen.py --update 🔗 yarGen\rGenerate Rules:\npython3 yarGen.py -m /temp/file_name -o sample.yar Test Rules:\nyara sample.yar /home/Samples/fles-to-detect-rules-on/ yarGen is useful when you\u0026rsquo;re dealing with large volumes of unknown malware and want quick initial detection logic.\nSome advanced Rules from Real Malware APT17 – ZoxPNG RAT\nrule APT17_Malware_Oct17_Gen { meta: description = \u0026#34;Detects APT17 malware\u0026#34; author = \u0026#34;Florian Roth\u0026#34; strings: $s1 = \u0026#34;Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64...)\u0026#34; fullword ascii $s2 = \u0026#34;hWritePipe2 Error:%d\u0026#34; fullword ascii ... condition: uint16(0) == 0x5a4d and filesize \u0026lt; 200KB and ( pe.imphash() == \u0026#34;414bbd566b700ea021cfae3ad8f4d9b9\u0026#34; or 1 of ($s*) or 6 of them ) } This rule uses both string-based matching and imphash verification to detect APT17 implants based on HTTP headers and command-and-control strings.\nTurla – Neuron Backdoor (Written in .NET)\nrule neuron_functions_classes_and_vars { strings: $class1 = \u0026#34;StorageUtils\u0026#34; $func1 = \u0026#34;AddConfigAsString\u0026#34; ... condition: uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and $dotnetMagic and 6 of them } The rule targets .NET class/function names unique to Turla’s Neuron malware and uses the BSJB magic header to identify .NET binaries.\n\u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot;\rHunting Evil in the Windows Scanning Suspicious Executables with YARA By opening suspicious .exe files in a hex editor like HxD, we can find hardcoded artifacts left by threat actors - like .pdb paths or unique string patterns.\nYou can identify these strings by running:\nhexdump dharma_sample.exe -C | grep crysis -n3 Example of Detecting above (Dharma) Ransomware\nrule ransomware_dharma { meta: author = \u0026#34;Madhukar Raina\u0026#34; version = \u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; description = \u0026#34;Simple rule to detect strings from Dharma ransomware\u0026#34; strings: $string_pdb = { 433A5C6372797369735C52656C656173655C5044425C7061796C6F61642E706462 } $string_ssss = { 73 73 73 73 73 62 73 73 73 } condition: all of them } Then scan the sample:\nyara64.exe -s C:\\Rules\\yara\\dharma_ransomware.yar C:\\Samples\\YARASigma\\ -r Scanning Running Processes (Detecting Meterpreter) To detect in-memory payloads like Metasploit’s Meterpreter, we can scan active processes using YARA rules that look for shellcode byte sequences, kernel32 API references, and known checksum values.\nrule meterpreter_reverse_tcp_shellcode { meta: author = \u0026#34;FDD @ Cuckoo sandbox\u0026#34; description = \u0026#34;Metasploit reverse_tcp shellcode\u0026#34; strings: $s1 = { fce8 8?00 0000 60 } $s2 = { 648b ??30 } $s3 = { 4c77 2607 } $s4 = \u0026#34;ws2_\u0026#34; $s5 = { 2980 6b00 } $s6 = { ea0f dfe0 } $s7 = { 99a5 7461 } condition: 5 of them } Now run the scanner for each process:\nGet-Process | ForEach-Object { \u0026#34;Scanning with Yara for meterpreter shellcode on PID\u0026#34; +$_.id; \u0026amp; \u0026#34;yara64.exe\u0026#34; \u0026#34;C:\\Rules\\yara\\meterpreter_shellcode.yar\u0026#34; $_.id } From the results, the meterpreter shellcode seems to have infiltrated a process with PID 9084. We can also guide the YARA scanner with a specific PID as follows.\nNow run rule over it:\nyara64.exe C:\\Rules\\yara\\meterpreter_shellcode.yar 9084 --print-strings Hunting with ETW Logs using SilkETW SilkETW is an open-source tool to work with Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) data. SilkETW provides enhanced visibility and analysis of Windows events for security monitoring, threat hunting, and incident response purposes.

It integrates Razorpay for secure payment processing and prioritizes both functionality and security to provide a seamless user experience for customers and sellers.\n🌐 Key Features 🔎 Product Search \u0026amp; Filtering: Easily browse, search, and filter products by categories or keywords. 🛒 Shopping Cart: Add multiple items, review your selections, and securely check out. 🗣️ User Reviews \u0026amp; Feedback: Customers can leave ratings and reviews to help others make informed decisions. 💬 Delivery Instructions: Personalized delivery options included at checkout. 🔐 Secure Registration \u0026amp; Login: Role-based access and protected authentication flow for users and admins. 💳 Razorpay Integration: Safe and smooth transactions through Razorpay’s payment gateway. \u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot;\r🔐 Security Enhancements Security was a top priority in the development process. The platform is protected against multiple OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities:\n✅ XSS (Cross-Site Scripting): DOMPurify and input sanitization are used across all user inputs to prevent malicious script injection. ✅ CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery): Routes are CSRF-protected with token validation in sensitive operations. ✅ Path Traversal \u0026amp; Local File Inclusion (LFI): All routes are controlled via React Router, and uploads are validated to reject any file types like .php, .phtml, etc. ✅ Broken Authentication: Proper session and token management ensures secure user identity. ✅ Secure Upload Handling: Files are validated and sanitized before being stored, preventing injection and traversal attacks. “If a user tries to upload a file with unsafe extensions, the system immediately blocks it and notifies them with a warning.”\n\u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot;\r📈 Admin \u0026amp; Seller Tools Sellers and admins can:\nView analytics and graphs for customer behavior Manage product inventory and orders efficiently Identify popular products by category or demographic Maintain a database of recurring customers and preferences 📦 Scalable \u0026amp; Future-Proof Designed with scalability in mind, One Shop Stop can easily expand to support a growing catalog and user base. The modular architecture allows integration of additional services, such as AI-based recommendations or multi-language support.\n\u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot;\r🎯 Conclusion \u0026ldquo;One Shop Stop aims to become a globally accessible and secure e-commerce platform, balancing intuitive design with enterprise-grade protection.\u0026rdquo;\nThis project reflects real-world e-commerce challenges and solutions with a focus on modern security practices, cloud integration, and data-driven decision-making.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/one-stop-shop/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt was basically my undergrade College Project and Built a responsive e-commerce platform using MERN stack with Razorpay integration for payments.
