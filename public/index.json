It was totally basic so I think we can neglect that. But as these domains just covers essential part, that was enough.\n\u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot;\rResources \u0026amp; Study Approach 📚 Resources I won’t make it unnecessary long and come to the point. All I did study was from a YouTube playlist by Peace of Code. That guy covered all of the basic concepts and solved around 350 questions with explanation.\n🎥 Peace of Code - AWS SAA-C03 Full Course + Questions\n📝 Study Approach I take notes majorly from his question solving parts because those tips are important like how you actually thought about question and how you can eliminate options. As you can see it’s short and concise notes, which I just referred once before starting my exam.\nAnd about my study hours, I didn’t really study much for this like roughly 3–4 hours a day and on exam day maybe I studies 6 hours as I took it in the evening. But I watch videos in 3x-4x speed that’s why I managed to complete that playlist this early.\nSomehow thinking about Cloud infrastructure came to me naturally and in fact, I had 50+ minutes left over in my exam. (total exam time is 130 minutes for 65 questions).\nTime for BONUS$ I got 50% off just by checking post of AWS Training \u0026amp; Certification LinkedIn! They usually have 50% off voucher always available or you can easily find it somewhere else. Currently they have 50% off for all Associate level exam till 21st May.\n\u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot; \u0026nbsp; \u0026middot;\rTrust me, this exam is just test foundational knowledge of AWS cloud and you don’t need to take stress over it. Watch that playlist and you are good to go.\nThank you for reading through, I wish you good luck if you are considering taking exam with AWS soon and meet you on DevSecOps project’s blog!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/post-1/","summary":"\u003cfigure class=\"align-center \"\u003e\n    \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/blog/blog-1-AWS/aws-saa-logo.png#center\"\n         alt=\"AWS SAA Badge\"/\u003e \u003cfigcaption\u003e\n            \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e“Sometimes starting something new opens the door to accomplishments you never expected.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"-how-i-decided-to-take-this-exam\"\u003e🚀 How I decided to take this exam\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the \u003cstrong\u003elast week of March\u003c/strong\u003e, I was exploring new things to learn and that curiosity led me to start a \u003cstrong\u003eDevSecOps project\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile diving deeper, I thought,\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e“Why not understand AWS deeply and get certified along the way?”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I looked into available AWS certifications and decided to try the \u003cstrong\u003eAWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C03)\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"How I passed AWS Solution Architect Associate - SAA in 5 days!"},{"content":"Eye-Sint was made during my undergrad as a final-year college project, and it became one of the most rewarding technical journeys I’ve had.

Funny enough, my journey began when my own LinkedIn account got hacked - lol, that\u0026rsquo;s a story for another time!\nCurrently, I\u0026rsquo;m diving deep into Cloud, AI, and their integration with security to build a secure CI/CD pipeline. I\u0026rsquo;m focused on threat modeling and automating that process by integrating LLM models in the workflow. This project will take a while but it\u0026rsquo;s my goal for the year.\nAlso recently, I\u0026rsquo;ve developed an interest in defensive side of the security like securing infrastructure and detecting anomalies. One of my goals this year is to build an AI-powered tool/pipeline to automate SOC workflows and detect unusual patterns in logs and infrastructure.\nAnd yeah of course, I enjoy offensive security as well and I can say I have strong fundamental holding there. I love solving CTF challenges and hacking machines on platforms like Hack The Box (HTB) and TryHackMe (THM). I really like API testing, exploring OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, and digging into business logic flaws during web app pentests.
