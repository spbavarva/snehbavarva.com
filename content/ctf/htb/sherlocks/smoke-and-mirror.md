## Scenario

Byte Doctor Reyes is investigating a stealthy post-breach attack where several expected security logs and Windows Defender alerts appear to be missing. He suspects the attacker employed defense evasion techniques to disable or manipulate security controls, significantly complicating detection efforts. Using the exported event logs, your objective is to uncover how the attacker compromised the system's defenses to remain undetected.
