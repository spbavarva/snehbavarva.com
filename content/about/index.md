<!-- need to update about section -->

I'm passionate about cybersecurity and always eager to explore different areas within the field. Funny enough, my journey began when my own LinkedIn account got hacked - lol, that's a story for another time!

Currently, I'm diving deep into **Cloud**, **AI**, and their integration with security to build a secure CI/CD pipeline. I'm focused on **threat modeling** and automating that process by integrating LLM models in the workflow. This project will take a while but it's my goal for the year.

Also recently, I've developed an interest in **defensive side of the security** like securing infrastructure and detecting anomalies. One of my goals this year is to build an AI-powered tool/pipeline to automate SOC workflows and detect unusual patterns in logs and infrastructure.

And yeah of course, I enjoy **offensive security** as well and I can say I have strong fundamental holding there. I love solving CTF challenges and hacking machines on platforms like **Hack The Box (HTB)** and **TryHackMe (THM)**. I really like **API testing**, exploring **OWASP Top 10** vulnerabilities, and digging into **business logic flaws** during web app pentests. Burp-`~`- I am coming for you next....
