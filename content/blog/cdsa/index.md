## Overview

Finally, I am happy to say that I am now HTB CDSA certified! Defenetaly it was good one to get and in this blog I will be sharing my journey from deciding to take this cert and actualy getting it. This will be long, so bare with it! Less go...

## Why this exam?

I am a huge fan of [HTB Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/) and it's content and I recommend that paltform to everyone to learn. I was just going through each of their job role path and though to give it a try for their [SOC Analyst Path](https://academy.hackthebox.com/path/preview/soc-analyst) a try in the December but I quit that in few days after doing few % and then I talked with people, look at study materials and some YT vidos of course - I figured out that Defensive side of security is best suited for me and I enjoy it more than Web-Pentesting (I hate BURP!).
