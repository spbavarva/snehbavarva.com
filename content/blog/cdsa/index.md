## Overview

Finally, I am happy to say that I am now HTB CDSA certified! Defenetaly it was good one to get and in this blog I will be sharing my journey from deciding to take this cert and actualy getting it. This will be long, so bare with it! Less go...

## Why this exam?

I am a huge fan of [HTB Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/) and it's content and I recommend that paltform to everyone to learn. I was just going through each of their job role path and though to give it a try for their [SOC Analyst Path](https://academy.hackthebox.com/path/preview/soc-analyst) a try in the December but I quit that in few days after doing few % and then I talked with people, look at study materials and some YT vidos of course - I figured out that Defensive side of security is best suited for me and I enjoy it more than Web-Pentesting (I hate BURP!).

I will come to [my background](/blog/cdsa/#my-background) and [timeline](/blog/cdsa/#my-timeline) of my study and how long I took to prepare for the exam later in the module. But this is how I decided to take the exam.

### who is it for

Below is what HTB has to say:
<!-- {{< figure src="/images/blog/blog-4-CDSA/cdsa-sec.jpg" alt="HTB CDSA" caption=" " align="center" >}} -->
{{< figure src="/images/blog/blog-4-CDSA/targeted.png" alt="targeted people" caption=" " align="center" >}}

But I do believe that this content (**Content**) is absoulately helpful for any Pentester or any Red teamer to understand how your actual attack works behind the scene and how it can be detected. For example, mimikatz can be easily detected, which is known by anyone but how it's getting detected? that's what you wil learn in this path.

I highly recommend anyone who wants to explore how blue team works or how incident response team works as well as to the red teamers and pentester to understand how defending team operates, which could give you more ways to bypass certain things with clear understanding.

## Pre-requisites

{{< figure src="/images/blog/blog-4-CDSA/pre-re.png" alt="Pre-requisites" caption="" align="center" >}}

It is advisable to have a bit of knowledge in web and AD infrastructure penetration testing concepts, as per HTB. If you are very new, I suggest taking the [Pre-Requisites](https://academy.hackthebox.com/path/preview/soc-analyst-prerequisites) path as it will be really helpful. Of course, the attacks or the offensive knowledge needed for the exam will be taught in the path itself.

**Personal suggestion**: But I still recommend to have some short of AD pentesting knowledge, which will help you to understand the full flow from attacking an infra to defending it. You can have this in that Pre-Requisites path and I strongly suggest you to at least do [AD module](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/introduction-to-active-directory) from that.

### Pricing


The SOC Analyst path is available at HTB Academy platform and fortunately there are multiple afforable subscription models for different users. I used their student subscription which is only $8 per months if you have a .edu email and I am using that from almost 1.5 years now. This will give you access to all the modules in the SOC Analyst path, the pre-requisites path and even access to all their main certifications paths (CPTS, CBBH and CDSA).

And yes, a voucher ($210) comes with two attempts. To qualify for the second attempt, you need to submit a report detailing your progress.

If you don’t have a .edu email fortunately there are some other affordable subscriptions, which you can find [here](https://academy.hackthebox.com/billing/monthly-billing).

## My background

A little bit of myself to give you context, whcih I am diiving into Defensive and Offensive categories.

**Defense side**
- No defensive side knowledge
- No DFIR knowledge
- Never touched ELK-stack, and Splunk only for college assignment
- Never did any sherlock or let's defend lab (cause I wasn't even aware lol)
- Basic knowledge of Malware 
- Average with Assembly

{{<newline>}}

**Offensive side**
- OSCP, eJPTv2 and some more
- Bachelor's degree in IT (stong networking and OS knowledge)
- Master's degree in Cybersecurity (on-going, still it was beneficial for Splunk)
- Solid understanding of AD Infra and Attacks
- Some boxes on [HTB](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/1143652) and [THM](https://tryhackme.com/p/mysticmido)

## Course overview

Overall this path was great to start awaken defensive side and CDSA path consists of the following 15 modules: (if you meet the pre-requisites, all the 15 modules are much easier to learn)
