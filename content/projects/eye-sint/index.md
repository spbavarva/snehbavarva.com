Eye-Sint was made during my undergrad as a final-year college project, and it became one of the most rewarding technical journeys I’ve had. I always wanted to build something useful in the OSINT and cybersecurity space and Eye-Sint brought both of those passions together.

And in fact, it was awarded Best Project of the 2024 Batch! 🏆

It's a **cloud-hosted, GUI-based OSINT tool** developed using **Python**, **Flask**, and **React.js**, capable of performing reconnaissance across the internet. What makes Eye-Sint special is its **modular design**: it brings together multiple OSINT functionalities that are usually scattered across several tools—all in one place.

## 🔍 What Can Eye-Sint Do?

- 🌐 **Web Scraping:** Collects website headers, extracts emails, performs domain lookups, and even brute-forces directories.
- 🧠 **Human Footprinting:** Gathers information about individuals, performs username lookups, phone number-based geolocation, and extracts PDF metadata.
- 🔐 **Port Scanning:** Detects open network ports to help with vulnerability assessments.
- 📁 **PDF Metadata Extraction:** Analyze files for hidden author details, creation dates, and more.
- 🌎 **Domain Search:** Perform whois lookups and SSL info extraction with just a few clicks.

### 📝 Research Publication

I’m super proud to say that our project also resulted in a **research paper**, titled:

> _“Enhancing OSINT Practices with Eye-Sint: A Multi-Module Intelligence Tool”_  
> 📄 Published in the **Indian Journal of Natural Sciences** (Vol.14 / Issue 82 / Feb 2024)

This paper explores the **technical architecture**, **methodologies**, and **comparative evaluation** of Eye-Sint against tools like Shodan and Maltego. We also emphasized **ethical OSINT**, ensuring Eye-Sint encourages responsible data usage, consent practices, and privacy considerations.

### 🚀 Why I Built This

While my other projects (like One Shop Stop) focused more on web development, **Eye-Sint was where I truly started diving deep into cybersecurity**. It helped me explore OSINT frameworks, automate repetitive tasks, and apply research knowledge into practice.

I also learned a lot about **secure data handling**, **modular architecture**, and **open-source collaboration**, and I can confidently say this project boosted my technical and professional growth.

> _“Eye-Sint is more than a project—it's a personal milestone that blends my passion for security, research, and open-source contribution.”_

## 🧠 What’s Next?

I'm actively working on:

- Adding **AI-assisted OSINT automation**
- Integrating **Maltego-like graphs**
- Expanding modules with more **social recon features**
